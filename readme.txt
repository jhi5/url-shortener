This is a microservice that takes a URL, creates a shortened value for it, stores it into a postgres database. The short url is then available by feeding the API the shortened value.

NOTE: I'm fully aware the URL validation isn't perfect. I'm currently using the valid-url module in lieu of writing my own validation.
